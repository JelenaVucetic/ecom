                    the protection of information received during transmission as well as after receipt, but no electronic
                    transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee complete security. Monargo uses SSL
                    technology (Secure Sockets Layer) to secure the encryption of personal and credit card information.
                    Monargo cooperates with a company that ensures the security of our services and your personal
                    information. Monargo users are additionally protected by changing the firewall and other technologies
                    to ensure data protection.

                 <p>Data protection is the responsibility of the user with appropriate protection of his or her mobile device
                    or computer, as well as protection of the username, password and appropriate software (antivirus)
                    protection of your electronic device. To ensure that these measures are effective in preventing
                    unauthorized access to your personal information, you must be aware of the security features available
                    to you through your browser. Use a browser that provides security feature settings before you submit
                    your personal or credit card information online. Please note that if you use a browser that does not
                    support SSL technology, such transfer of personal data may be risky. <br><br>
                    Most browsers allow notifications if you are on a website that does not provide a secure connection or if
                    you are submitting information through an unsecured connection. Monargo recommends that you
                    enable these features of your browser to help keep your personal information secure. You can also track
                    your address (URL). Secure Internet addresses start with https: // instead of http: //, along with the
                    secure connection symbol used by your browser (usually the lock symbol at the beginning of the
                    internet address). Such a symbol indicates the use of secure communication with the browser. Please
                    check the details (correctness) of your site&#39;s security certificate at the same time. <br><br>

                         available to the merchant. 3D Secure protection for all merchants and customers - AllSecure Payment 
                         Gateway uses the highest global standards of data protection and privacy. All merchants using the
